Welcome to Qu-Prolog 8.7.

Qu-Prolog 8.7 is an extended Prolog with built-in support for quantifiers, 
object-variables and substitutions. It is designed as an implementation
language for systems such as interactive theorem provers.

This version of Qu-Prolog also has support for multi-threading and high-level
symbolic communication using both the ICM and ELVIN systems.

Please see the INSTALL instructions for obtaining ICM and for building 
Qu-Prolog.

The doc/user directory contains a user manual and the doc/manual directory
contains a reference manual both as a .ps document and as a HTML document.
For the HTML document point your web browser at

The examples directory contains some example programs that use the extensions
of Qu-Prolog. These examples are referred to from the user manual.
