ccicm is a simple example of the use of the ICMEnvironment class and
the Qu-Prolog term encoder/decoder classes.

Readers should also look at src/xqpdebug/xqpdebug.cc for another example
of using the ICMEnvironment class.

If you wish to use this to construct your own GUI, for example, then you should
copy all the .h files (including icm.h) to your working directory as well as
icm_env.cc and encode.cc.

You should look at Makefile and in particular note INCPATH and LIBS.
You may need to change the paths for icm to suit your environment.
