Installing Qu-Prolog 8.7

Execute the following

./configure
source PROFILE_CMDS
make

This should have build the system.

The config files have been pre-built using LINUX RedHat 9.0 and
so you may need to run autoconf before configure if you are using
different versions of LINUX or UNIX.

If you have any problems please let us know.

Look in PROFILE_CMDS or LOGIN_CMDS to see how to set up your environment.

NOTES
-----
If configure does not find some files then paths may need to be changed.
Changing PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH may be enough. 

On some machines the paths for the includes for the STL libraries are 
not automatically set by gcc. If you get a compiler error saying that it 
can't find sstream then try
locate sstream
to find the path to the STL include directory.
Then try
./configure --with-gcclib=PATH
where PATH is the path to the STL library includes.

Qu-Prolog has been build on LINUX (Redhat 6.0 or greater).

It has also been ported to SOLARIS using the gcc version 2.95.2 compiler.



QT GUI
------
If you have the QT libraries and qmake then you can build a qt interface to
the qp interpreter (xqp) and for the debugger (xqpdebug) by executing the
following

make xqp

Before doing this you should check that the environment variable QTDIR is
set to the QT home - e.g. /usr/lib/qt-3.1.

Installing on MacOSX
--------------------
The system should install on MacOSX without problems.
