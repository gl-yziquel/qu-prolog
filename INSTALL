Installing Qu-Prolog 6.2

Execute the following

./configure
source PROFILE_CMDS
make

This should have build the system.

The config files have been pre-built using LINUX RedHat 7.2 and
so you may need to run autoconf before configure if you are using
different versions of LINUX or UNIX.

If you have any problems please let us know.


Look in PROFILE_CMDS or LOGIN_CMDS to see how to set up your environment.

NOTES

If configure does not find some files then paths may need to be changed.
Changing PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH may be enough. If not then change configure.in
and run autoconf and try again.

configure looks for tcl/tk libraries and includes but you may need to help
configure. If the tk library is not found then try
./configure --with-libtk=PATH
where PATH is the path to libtk.so (or libtk8.?.so).

This should also be the location of libtcl.so but if not try
./configure --with-libtcl=PATH

If configure can't find tk.h then try
./configure --with-tkinclude=PATH

On some machines the paths for the includes for the STL libraries are 
not automatically set by gcc. If you get a compiler error saying that it 
can't find sstream then try
locate sstream
to find the path to the STL include directory.
Then try
./configure --with-gcclib=PATH
where PATH is the path to the STL library includes.

The high-level communication of Qu-Prolog 6.2 relies on the ICM package.
If this is not present on your system then Qu-Prolog will build without the
communication.

The ICM package can be downloaded from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/networkagent/

If this package is installed before running configure then configure should 
find it and build a system with high-level communication.

Qu-Prolog has been build on LINUX (Redhat 5.2 or greater).

It has also been ported to SOLARIS using the gcc version 2.95.2 compiler.


Installing on MacOSX
--------------------
This port is unfinished - the Tcl/Tk interpreter does not work.
Before running configure you should do the following

mv src/tkICM_OSX.c src/tkICM.c

and you should install the dynamic library linker (dlcompat) from
http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/dlcompat

Although the Tcl/Tk interpreter does not work you will still need to have 
Tcl/Tk installed.

After this you can build the system as described above - i.e.

./configure
source PROFILE_CMDS
make
